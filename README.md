# Swift-3-Maths-Games
Simple Swift 3 Maths Games built with my nine year old son.
A few simple maths games for kids written in Swift 3 Made as a learning exercise with my nine year old son - to teach him maths and coding at the same time.

## Addition, Multiplication and Subtraction
Each game is hosted within its own View Controller and related View Controller Swift file. Still to come Division. I've also built a calculator app that uses a similar UI and have a Maths UI Kit PSD I'll upload containing the Tab Icons.
